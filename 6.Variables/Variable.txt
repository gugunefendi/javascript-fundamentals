Variables
Variable is a container to store data.
Javascript variable can be declared 4 ways:
1. Automatically
2. Use var
3. Use let
4. Use const

Example automatically variable declaration:
x = 5;
y = 10;
x and y are undeclared variables.
They are automatically declared when first use.

Example variable declaration using var:
var x = 5;
var y = 10;
var z = x + y;

!!NOTE!!
var keyword was used in all Javascript code from 1995 - 2015
let and const keywords were added to Javascript in 2015
var keyword should only be used for older browser

Example variable declaration using let:
let name = 'Gunawan';
let age = 33;

Example variable declaration using const:
const x = 5;
const y = 10;
const z = x + y;

Example mixed variable declaration:
const productOne = 100;
const productTwo = 200;
let total = productOne + productTwo;
// productOne and productTwo are declared using const keyword, these are values cannot be changed
// the total value can be changed

When to use var, let, and const?
1. always declare variable
2. always use const keyword for values that should not be changed
3. always use const if the type should not be changed (Array and Object)
4. only use let if you can't use const
5. only use var if you must support older browsers

The Assignment Operators
In Javascript, the equal sign (=) is an 'assignment' operator, not an 'equal to' operator.
The equal to operator can be write use == in Javascript.

Declaring Variables in Javascript
Creating a variable in Javascript is called 'declaring' a variable.
Example:
let carName;
// After declaring the variable, the variable has no value (technically is is undefined).
// To assign a value to the variable, use equal (=) sign.
carName = 'Volvo';

One Statement Many Variables
You can declare many variable in one statement.
Start statement with let and separate variable with comma.
Example:
let firsName, lastName, age, city;
let person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;

Value = Undefined
A variable declared with out a value, will have a value undefined.
let userName;
console.log(userName); // Output: undefined

Re-declaring Javascript variables
if you want re-declare Javascript variable that delared with 'var', it will not lose the value.
Example:
var x = 5;
var x;
console.log(x); // Output: 5

!! Note !!
You can not re-declare a variable declared with 'let' or 'const'.
let carName = "Volvo";
let carName; // This will give an error.
console.log(carName); //
